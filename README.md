Hi! It's Haley!

1. I made a web application for anyone who likes to keep a task list on their computer!

    Basically, when the user launches the application, they must register or login. Afterwards, they can input any task they need to do in the text space and click either the enter button or the plus sign at the end of the text box. When they click either the key or the button, the inputted task will display below the text box.
    If the user wants to mark a task as complete, they can click the toggle button below 'Complete' and if they don't want to see the task in the list anymore, they can click the trash can icon!
    The user can also log out and log into a different account or register with a new email.
    Although I got the login and registeration features to work, the same tasks show up regardless of what email or 'account' the user logs in with, I think there's a problem with correctly filtering through each to do's ids.

2. In terms of features I chose to include, I used
    Components and Mobile Responsiveness (Frontend)
    User Registration / Login / Logout Functionality, Integration with Database (Firebase), and Objects (Backend)
    Deployed my site on netlify.app (Misc)

3. I spent about 5 hours making this application. I learned about React, Bootstrap, Firebase, and such over the summer so some aspects of    the application (like connecting to firebase and figuring out user login and registration) was pulled from stuff I tried to code over the summer but a lot of time went into just reviewing and relearning some of the concepts. Also, around 1.5 hours was spent trying to figure out how to filter the to do's based on the what user logged in but I was no table to figure it out unfortunately.

4. Deployment Link

https://spark-web-app-task-list.herokuapp.com/login

If the link doesn't work for some reason, simply type in the terminal ----  
 npm install 
 
   npm i react-router-dom  
    npm i firebase  
    npm i bootstrap-icons 
    npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap  
    npm start


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
